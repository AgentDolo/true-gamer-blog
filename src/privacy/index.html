  <h2 class="section-title">Data we collect: Gameplay data</h2>
  <p>We collect gameplay data from game APIs programmatically. We store data on our servers, which allows us to aggregate the data and provide our visitors with more granular and insightful analysis than otherwise available in-game. We do not sell the information we collect to third-parties.</p>

  <p>We collect and store the following information:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>User platform, platform-specific user ID, match history, match details, which includes, among other gameplay stats, the in-game nickname and the clantag.</li>
    <li>We refresh all user-specific data collected from the games no less frequently than every 30 days.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>How to remove your gameplay data from True Gamer?</h3>
  <p>If you do not want your stats profile to be publicly searchable on True Gamer, you can change your data privacy settings on Call of Duty or Activision websites. You may unlink the account or prevent it from being searched or your information from being shared with third-party websites or apps, such as True Gamer, through your Activision profile settings.</p>

  <p>Your user platform, platform-specific user ID, and list of match IDs will be deleted from our servers the next time we try to refresh your match history. Your profile will no longer be searchable or accessible on True Gamer. You will be removed from the leaderboards.</p>

  <p>Note that there is no automatic real-time link between Activision account settings and True Gamer, and it might take up to 30 days until we attempt to refresh your match history. Therefore, your profile will not be deleted immediately upon the change of your Activision data privacy settings. You may refresh the profile by yourself on True Gamer or contact us if you want the removal to be immediate.</p>
