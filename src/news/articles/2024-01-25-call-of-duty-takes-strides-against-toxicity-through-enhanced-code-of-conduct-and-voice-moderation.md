Code of Conduct Update:



The "Treat Everyone with Respect" pillar of the Call of Duty Code of Conduct has been refined to reinforce the stand against the use of games for promoting discrimination or violence. The updated language explicitly addresses bullying, harassment, and offensive language based on various attributes, emphasizing the importance of treating all community members with dignity and respect.



Read the updated Code of Conduct at CallofDuty.com/Values. This update will also be reflected in-game after a subsequent title update.



Moderation Findings:



Voice moderation, introduced in a North American beta before the global launch of Call of Duty®: Modern Warfare® III, has yielded valuable insights:



Voice Moderation Enforcement: Over 2 million accounts faced in-game enforcement for disruptive voice chat, aligning with the Code of Conduct.



Reporting Trends: Only 1 in 5 users reported disruptive behavior identified by the voice moderation system, highlighting the need for increased reporting. Messages thanking players for reporting have been implemented, with plans for additional feedback in the future.



Reduction in Repeat Offenders: Monthly data analysis revealed an 8% reduction in repeat offenders since the introduction of in-game voice chat moderation.



Toxic Voice Chat Exposure: Call of Duty witnessed a ~50% reduction in players exposed to severe instances of disruptive voice chat since Modern Warfare III's launch.



The voice moderation system, active in Call of Duty®: Modern Warfare® II, Modern Warfare III, and Call of Duty®: Warzone™, globally mutes players who violate the Code of Conduct. Future updates will include more languages to broaden the system's reach.



Call of Duty remains dedicated to combating toxicity and will continually enhance moderation tools to ensure a fair and enjoyable experience for all players.
